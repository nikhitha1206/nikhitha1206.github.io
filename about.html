            <p>The iPhone is a smartphone made by Apple that combines a computer, iPod, digital camera and cellular phone into one device with a touchscreen interface. The iPhone runs the iOS operating system (OS), and as of 2017, there were 2.2 million apps available for it through the Apple App Store, according to Statista.
                Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007, at the Macworld 2007 conference in San Francisco. It went on sale June 29 of that year.         
                Apple sold 13 million iPhones in the device's first five quarters on the market. In 2010, the number of iPhones sold since its debut surpassed 70 million. In 2011, Apple announced it had sold 100 million iPhones. That same year, Apple eclipsed Nokia as the mobile phone manufacturer with the most annual revenue.</p>    
            <h2>iPhone models</h2>
            <p>Apple regularly releases new iPhone models, introducing new features and design changes.
                As of 2017, the newest version was the iPhone X (pronounced iPhone 10), which eliminated the traditional Home button in favor of a fully touchscreen interface.</p>
            <h2>iPhone</h2>
            <p>The first-generation iPhone was extremely thin (only 11.6 mm thick) but wider and longer than many comparable devices. The display area was a 3.5 inch-wide screen with a multitouch interface and unusually high resolution (160 pixels per inch). Unlike most other smartphones at the time, iPhone did not use a hardware keyboard or a stylus. Instead, a user relied on multiple taps and drags to navigate through iPhone OS 1.0, a mobile version of Apple's OS X for Mac computers. Like the iPod, the iPhone synchronized data with a user's personal computer via a USB port, using Apple iTunes as client software.</p>
